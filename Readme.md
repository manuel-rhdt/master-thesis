# Master Thesis

This is a package of code used to research information processing inside of cells. In
the `docs` directory there are some notes about the research background.

## What this is for

The idea is to calculate the *mutual information* between entire trajectories of
events. The mutual information between two random variables describes how much the
uncertainty about the value of one random variable is reduced when the other random
variable's value is known. Here each random variable is an entire trajectory or in other
words: a series of events with associated timestamps. Currently the simulation is
limited to well-mixed chemical reaction networks where every chemical reaction is
considered an event.

When we think about entire trajectories it is helpful to have the picture of one
variable being the signal and the other variable being the response of some system or
channel to that signal. Then we would like to know by how much we reduce the uncertainty
of what the signal is when we have access to the response. In other words: we describe
how much information about the signal is still present in the response.

Here we are interested in the information processing efficiency of biochemical networks.
To estimate the mutual information between chosen signals and the responses generated by
different reaction networks we employ a monte carlo sampling technique. This way we can
make the integration over the space of trajectories viable on today's computers.
